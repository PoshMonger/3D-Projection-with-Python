# 3D-Projection-with-Python
3D projection with python and related libraries

-- This is for educational purposes getting to practice python syntax and also take a look at the theories behind graphics and 3D projection. 
-- Many of the libraries implemented abstract the actual projection from 3d to 2d coordinates, but definitely implements matricies for transformations.

-- Linear algebra reccommended to get a full understanding of the math here, although again, much is abstracted with numpy, pygame, and numba libraries.

THE FINALT OUTCOME can turn any .obj file into a 3D rendering. This example uses the .obj file of a tank and the ability to rotate on all 3 axes, scale, and transform. 

We are also implementing camera perspective.
